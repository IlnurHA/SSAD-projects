Implementation of the Observer pattern for restaurant app (SSAD assignment 4 BS21)

# Task

The iPad restaurant application aims at replacing the conventional menu system which is time consuming and old fashioned. Meal orders can be taken on an iPAD, which will have the complete menu offered by the restaurant/hotel. Each menu item, under any of the above categories comes with a description of the item, ratings given by previous customers, a large image for better knowledge of the dish, and the cost of the item. The customer could also use the iPAD provided by room service for reserving a table. The languages used for development in this project are Objective C for developing the application for iPad & for the server part PHP is being used as the language. It can be used in computer science as well as It projects for students.
